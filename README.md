# FileGame

This is a game prototype made by Martin, Sille, Omar Aslam, Melik, Steven and David during the basic game development course in Tallinn University.

Martin was responsible for: player and camera movement; game environment
Steven designed the collectible file extensions and implemented them into the game. Also he made a robot who moved around in one of the rooms.
Sille added audio to the game.
Melik designed and implemented the health system. Also he wrote fade-out transitions and loading codes.
David made and implemented the main menu.
Omar had the most experience - so he oversaw the project, made corrections and finalized the program so that it would work without problems.
